The files in this repo are the schematic and Arduino Sketches used on the Shift Register Circuit Build 102 page at www.rheingoldheavy.com

These sketches and schematics show the construction of a binary counter and demonstrate the use of the OE and SRCLR pins.

There are four sketches...

1. The Binary Counter          - displaying binary numbers using LED patterns
2. Using the OE and SRCLR pins - using Output Enable and Shift Register Clear to turn off and fade the display
